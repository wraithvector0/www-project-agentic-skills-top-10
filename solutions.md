# Open Source Tools Supporting AST10 Mitigations

This page catalogs open source tools that implement mitigations for one or more AST10 risks. Listings are factual and vendor-neutral. Inclusion does not imply OWASP endorsement.

## How to Add a Tool

Submit a PR adding your tool using the template at the bottom of this page. All fields are required. Entries that read as promotional will be asked to revise.

## AgentMint

**Description:** Runtime enforcement and signed evidence for AI agent tool calls. Evaluates every tool call against a human-approved scope before execution. Produces cryptographically signed, hash-chained receipts for every decision (allow or deny).

**License:** MIT  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/aniketh-maddipati/agentmint-python](https://github.com/aniketh-maddipati/agentmint-python)  
**Install:** `pip install agentmint`  
**Dependencies:** 2 (pynacl, requests)

### AST Risks Addressed

**AST01 — Malicious Skills:** Ed25519 signatures and SHA-256 hash chains on every receipt provide tamper-evident audit trails. Evidence packages are independently verifiable without vendor software.

**AST02 — Supply Chain Compromise:** Signed plans include key ID for provenance tracking. Receipt chains with optional RFC 3161 timestamps support independent verification of action history.

**AST03 — Over-Privileged Skills:** Runtime scope enforcement using pattern matching with wildcard hierarchies. Actions outside the approved scope are blocked before execution. Checkpoint mechanism requires human re-approval for sensitive actions.

**AST04 — Insecure Metadata:** Plan metadata (scope, delegates, checkpoints, expiry) is covered by Ed25519 signature. Modifying any field invalidates the plan.

**AST07 — Update Drift:** Plans have TTL-based expiry. Policy version is captured in every receipt via a policy hash (SHA-256 of canonical scope, checkpoints, and delegates).

**AST08 — Poor Scanning:** Shield module scans tool inputs for prompt injection (23 pattern categories), PII, secrets, encoding evasion, and structural injection. Pattern-based only; does not perform semantic analysis.

**AST09 — No Governance:** Per-agent session tracking with configurable escalation thresholds. Circuit breaker rate limiting prevents runaway execution. Signed audit trail links every action to a human-approved plan.

### Risks Not Addressed

**AST05 — Unsafe Deserialization:** Does not parse skill manifests or configs from untrusted sources.  
**AST06 — Weak Isolation:** Runs in-process. Does not provide containerization or sandbox isolation.  
**AST10 — Cross-Platform Reuse:** Receipt format is tool-specific; does not yet implement the Universal Skill Format.

### Known Limitations

- Scanning is regex-based. Semantic and behavioral attacks are not detected.
- Runs in-process alongside the agent. A compromised process can bypass enforcement.
- No web dashboard or UI. Designed as a library, not a platform.

### Framework Integration

Integrates via hooks with CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, and MCP. Typical integration requires approximately 20 lines of code per framework.

## WraithVector

**Description:** Agent Authority Management gateway for AI agents. Sits between agents and tool execution, enforcing role-based permissions before every action and producing cryptographically hash-chained audit records for every decision — ALLOW or BLOCK.

**License:** MIT  
**Repository:** https://github.com/wraithvector0/wraithvector-openclaw  
**Install:** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wraithvector0/wraithvector-openclaw/main/install.sh | bash`
**Dependencies:** requests

### AST Risks Addressed

**AST03 — Over-Privileged Skills:** Role-based tool permission enforcement at runtime. Each agent role has an explicit allowlist of tools. Actions outside the approved scope are blocked before execution. Fail-closed by default.

**AST06 — Weak Isolation:** Fail-closed enforcement — if the governance layer fails or is unreachable, execution is blocked. No fail-open fallback.

**AST09 — No Governance:** Per-agent audit logging with hash-chained decision records. Every ALLOW and BLOCK is stored with agent ID, role, action, timestamp, and SHA-256 chain hash linking to the previous decision. PDF evidence export supported.

### Risks Not Addressed

**AST01 — Malicious Skills:** Does not scan skill manifests for malicious content.  
**AST02 — Supply Chain Compromise:** Does not implement registry transparency or dependency pinning.  
**AST05 — Untrusted External Instructions:** Does not currently provide dedicated controls for untrusted external instructions.
**AST07 — Update Drift:** No policy version pinning or TTL expiry.  
**AST08 — Poor Scanning:** No semantic or behavioral scanning.  
**AST10 — Cross-Platform Reuse:** OpenClaw-specific plugin. Universal Skill Format not yet implemented.

### Known Limitations

- Enforcement runs as a plugin hook. A compromised process can bypass it.
- No containerization or sandbox isolation.

### Framework Integration

Integrates with OpenClaw via the before-tool-call hook for runtime policy enforcement and audit logging.
